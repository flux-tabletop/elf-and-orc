# TODO: Size
Like life expectancy, your size begins at 0 and is
determined by adding the height listed under each
birth parent. As an elf-halfling, you would increase
your height by 16 + 1d4 inches from your father and
27 + 1d8 inches from your mother. That would make
you about 4'2".
If you are 45 inches tall (3'9") or taller, you are
Medium in size. Anyone shorter than 45 inches is
considered a Small creature.
